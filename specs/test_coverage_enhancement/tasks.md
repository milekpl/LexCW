# Implementation Plan: Test Coverage Enhancement

This document outlines the implementation tasks for enhancing the test coverage of the application, based on the requirements in `specification.md`.

1.  [ ] **Achieve 90%+ Test Coverage for Core Components**
    *   This epic covers the work required to increase the test coverage of the core components to over 90%.

    1.1. [ ] **Fix Remaining XQuery Namespace Issues in Advanced CRUD Tests**
        *   Identify and fix the failing advanced CRUD tests that are caused by XQuery namespace issues.
        *   **Requirements**: `18.2`

    1.2. [ ] **Complete Test Coverage for Core Components to 90%+**
        *   Write additional unit and integration tests for all core components to achieve a test coverage of over 90%.
        *   This includes the database connectors, parser modules, and utility functions.
        *   **Requirements**: `4.1.2`, `18.2`

    1.3. [ ] **Add Performance Benchmarks for Core Operations**
        *   Create performance tests for the core operations of the application, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting entries.
        *   These benchmarks will be used to track the performance of the application over time.
        *   **Requirements**: `4.1.3`, `18.2`
