        *   **Requirements**: `3.2.2`, `8.2.1`, `18.2`

2.  [ ] **Machine Learning Models**
    *   This epic covers the integration of machine learning models into the application.

    2.1. [ ] **POS Tagging Integration**
        *   Integrate a Part-of-Speech (POS) tagger, such as spaCy, into the application.
        *   **Requirements**: `3.2.3`, `18.2`

    2.2. [ ] **Pronunciation Systems**
