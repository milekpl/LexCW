- ‚úÖ API now uses dynamic service layer for all range data
- ‚úÖ Individual range endpoints working with parent-based hierarchy
- ‚úÖ Integration tests verify API returns all ranges from sample file
- ‚úÖ Service layer correctly falls back to sample file when database has no ranges

‚úÖ PHASE 3: Service Layer De-hardcoding and Testing (COMPLETED)

- ‚úÖ Parent-child relationships via 'parent' attribute fully implemented
- ‚úÖ Phase 4 UI tests implemented and passing (14/14 tests)
- ‚úÖ Consolidated integration tests with comprehensive API coverage
- ‚úÖ Removed duplicate test files and consolidated functionality

‚úÖ PHASE 4: UI Components and Special Editors Testing (COMPLETED)
- ‚úÖ Implemented comprehensive UI tests for dynamic range integration
- ‚úÖ Tests for hierarchical range selection (tree views for semantic domains)
- ‚úÖ Tests for special editors for different range types
- ‚úÖ Tests for UI graceful handling of missing ranges
- ‚úÖ Tests for dynamic range dropdown population from API
- ‚úÖ Tests for range validation and error handling in UI
- ‚úÖ Tests for multilingual range display
- ‚úÖ Tests for search and filter functionality in large ranges
- ‚úÖ All 14 Phase 4 tests passing successfully

  - ‚úÖ API Layer: All 21 ranges properly exposed via REST endpoints (/api/ranges, /api/ranges/<id>)
  - ‚úÖ Hierarchy Structure: Full parent-child relationships working (semantic domains with 9 hierarchical elements)
  - ‚úÖ Integration: Complete parser ‚Üí service ‚Üí API flow validated and working
- üîÑ Address database connection issues in relation/etymology tests
- üîÑ Consolidate unique functionality from duplicate range tests
- üîÑ Performance testing with large range hierarchies
- üîÑ Verify namespace handling compatibility
- üîÑ Final cleanup and ensure >90% test coverage

FILES CREATED/MODIFIED:
1. ‚úÖ tests/test_lift_ranges_comprehensive.py - Comprehensive range parser tests
2. ‚úÖ tests/test_lift_ranges_integration.py - Consolidated integration tests with API coverage

3. lexical-relation
4. note-type
5. paradigm
6. reversal-type
7. semantic-domain-ddp4 (large hierarchy)
8. status
9. users
10. location
11. anthro-code

- Multi-language labels and descriptions
- GUID support for range elements
- Trait support (name-value pairs)
- Abbreviation support
- Catalog source ID support
- Proper namespace handling

SUCCESS CRITERIA:

- Service layer tests for range loading/caching
- UI tests for dynamic range display
- End-to-end tests with sample data
- Performance tests with large datasets
- Error handling tests for edge cases
