# Multilingual Fields Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Empty Language Dropdowns**:
   - Added project languages to the template context in both edit_entry and add_entry views
   - Ensured language options are properly populated from project settings

2. **Sense Reordering**:
   - Fixed the reindexSenses function to properly update all sense indices
   - Added support for move up/down buttons to reorder senses
   - Ensured sense numbers are updated in all relevant places

3. **Multilingual Notes Support**:
   - Extended the MultilingualSenseFieldsManager to handle note fields
   - Added addNoteLanguageField method for note-specific language fields
   - Ensured consistent handling of all multilingual fields

4. **Form Freezing During Save**:
   - Improved form serialization with timeout handling
   - Added progress indicators for better user feedback
   - Enhanced error handling during submission

## Files Modified

1. **app/views.py**:
   - Added project_languages to the template context in edit_entry and add_entry views
   - Extracted language information from project settings

2. **app/static/js/entry-form.js**:
   - Enhanced reindexSenses function to update all relevant elements
   - Added move up/down functionality for senses
   - Improved error handling during form submission

3. **app/static/js/multilingual-sense-fields.js**:
   - Extended to handle note fields in addition to definition and gloss fields
   - Added addNoteLanguageField method for note-specific language fields
   - Improved language selection handling

4. **app/templates/entry_form.html**:
   - Fixed duplicate extra_js blocks
   - Ensured all necessary scripts are included

## How the Fix Works

1. **Language Options**:
   - The server extracts language information from project settings
   - Languages are passed to the template as project_languages
   - Dropdowns are populated with these languages

2. **Sense Reordering**:
   - Move up/down buttons use DOM manipulation to reorder senses
   - After reordering, reindexSenses is called to update all indices
   - All relevant elements (headers, buttons, field names) are updated

3. **Multilingual Fields**:
   - A single manager class handles all multilingual fields
   - Field-specific methods ensure proper naming conventions
   - Language selection is consistent across all field types

4. **Form Submission**:
   - Progress indicators show submission status
   - Timeouts prevent UI freezing during serialization
   - Error handling provides clear feedback on issues

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Language Handling**:
   - Test adding multiple languages to definitions, glosses, and notes
   - Verify that language dropdowns show all available project languages
   - Test removing languages and adding them back

2. **Sense Reordering**:
   - Test reordering senses with both drag-and-drop and move buttons
   - Verify that sense numbers update correctly in all places
   - Test adding examples after reordering senses

3. **Form Submission**:
   - Test saving large entries with multiple senses and languages
   - Verify that the form doesn't freeze during submission
   - Check that all multilingual data is properly saved

## Future Improvements

1. **Language Selection UX**:
   - Add visual indicators for primary/secondary languages
   - Implement language preference ordering
   - Add quick language selection buttons

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Further optimize form serialization for very large forms
   - Implement lazy loading for complex form sections

3. **Enhanced Validation**:
   - Add language-specific validation rules
   - Implement cross-field validation for multilingual content
