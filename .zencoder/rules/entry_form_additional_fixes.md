## How the Fixes Work

1. **Web Worker Improvements**:
   - Uses document.currentScript to get the base path for the worker script
   - Adds a small delay before posting messages to ensure worker is ready
   - Filters out file inputs to reduce data transfer

2. **Reindexing Improvements**:
   - Uses a two-phase update process to avoid index conflicts
   - Adds temporary attributes to track original indices
   - Uses more precise regex patterns for field name updates

3. **Loading Performance**:
   - Shows a loading indicator during initialization
   - Processes dynamic selects in batches
   - Adds small delays between operations to allow UI updates

4. **Multilingual Field Handling**:
   - Updates container data attributes first
   - Uses more precise field name updates
   - Adds better logging for debugging

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Form Loading**:
   - Verify that the loading indicator appears during initialization
   - Check that the form loads completely without errors
   - Test with entries of various sizes

2. **Sense Reordering**:
   - Test moving senses up and down
   - Verify that field names are updated correctly
   - Check that multilingual fields maintain their values

3. **Form Submission**:
   - Test submitting forms of various sizes
   - Verify that the form doesn't hang during submission
   - Check that all data is saved correctly

4. **Error Recovery**:
   - Test with network interruptions
   - Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed
   - Check that the form remains usable after errors
