# Sense Reordering Buttons Fix

## Issue Fixed

The sense reordering buttons (up and down arrows) were not working due to a mismatch between the HTML class names and the JavaScript event handlers.

## Root Causes

1. **Class Name Mismatch**:
   - HTML template used `.move-sense-up` and `.move-sense-down` classes
   - JavaScript was looking for `.move-sense-up-btn` and `.move-sense-down-btn` classes

2. **Template Inconsistency**:
   - The template for new senses was missing the move buttons
   - The structure of the sense header was different between existing and new senses

3. **Event Binding**:
   - Event delegation was not properly capturing clicks on newly added senses

## Files Modified

1. **app/static/js/entry-form.js**:
   - Updated event handlers to use the correct class names
   - Added direct event listeners for newly added senses
   - Added logging for better debugging

2. **app/templates/entry_form.html**:
   - Updated the sense template to include move buttons
   - Made the structure consistent with existing senses

## How the Fix Works

1. **Class Name Alignment**:
   - JavaScript event handlers now look for the same classes used in the HTML
   - Added console logging to track button clicks and actions

2. **Template Consistency**:
   - Updated the sense template to include the same structure and buttons as existing senses
   - Ensured proper data attributes are set on new elements

3. **Robust Event Handling**:
   - Added direct event listeners to new senses as a backup
   - Improved error handling and logging

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Basic Reordering**:
   - Test moving existing senses up and down
   - Verify that the sense numbers update correctly

2. **New Senses**:
   - Add new senses and test their reordering buttons
   - Verify that new senses can be moved both up and down

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Test moving the first sense down
   - Test moving the last sense up
   - Test with a single sense (buttons should be disabled or have no effect)

4. **Form Submission**:
   - Reorder senses and submit the form
   - Verify that the new order is preserved after saving
