# Test Configuration Summary

## Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. Unknown pytest marks
- **Problem**: Tests using `@pytest.mark.unit` but mark not registered
- **Solution**: Added all custom marks to `pytest.ini`
- **Result**: No more "Unknown pytest.mark.unit" warnings

### 2. Tests in wrong directories
- **Problem**: Unit tests were in `tests/integration/` directory
- **Solution**: Moved unit tests to correct locations:
  - `test_form_serializer_unit.py` → `tests/`
  - `test_form_serializer_unit_fast.py` → `tests/`
  - Split `test_etymology_ui.py` into unit and integration parts

### 3. VS Code test discovery
- **Problem**: VS Code not properly discovering and running tests
- **Solution**: Created comprehensive configuration files

## Configuration Files Created/Updated

### 1. `pytest.ini` - Pytest Configuration
```ini
[pytest]
markers =
    integration: mark test as integration test (requires real database)
    unit: mark test as unit test (uses mocking)
    selenium: mark test as requiring Selenium WebDriver
    performance: mark test as performance/benchmark test
    postgresql: mark test as requiring PostgreSQL
    # ... and more

testpaths = tests
python_files = test_*.py
python_classes = Test*
python_functions = test_*
addopts = -v --tb=short --strict-markers --disable-warnings
```

### 2. `.vscode/settings.json` - VS Code Test Configuration
```json
{
    "python.testing.pytestEnabled": true,
    "python.testing.unittestEnabled": false,
    "python.testing.pytestArgs": [
        "tests",
        "--tb=short",
        "--strict-markers",
        "-v",
        "--disable-warnings"
    ],
    "python.testing.autoTestDiscoverOnSaveEnabled": true
}
```

### 3. Updated `conftest.py` files
- **Unit tests** (`tests/conftest.py`): Automatic mocking, unit test marking
- **Integration tests** (`tests/integration/conftest.py`): Real database with sample LIFT files

## Test Organization

### Unit Tests (Fast, Mocked)
- **Location**: `tests/test_*.py`
- **Mark**: `@pytest.mark.unit` (automatically applied)
- **Count**: 213 tests
- **Execution**: Very fast (all dependencies mocked)

### Integration Tests (Real Database)
- **Location**: `tests/integration/test_*.py`
- **Mark**: `@pytest.mark.integration` (automatically applied)
- **Count**: 830 tests
- **Execution**: Slower (real BaseX database with sample LIFT files)

## Running Tests

### Command Line
```bash
# Unit tests only (fast, for development)
pytest tests/ -m 'not integration'

# Integration tests only (requires BaseX server)
pytest tests/integration/ -m integration

# All tests
pytest tests/

# Specific test file
pytest tests/test_entry_model_comprehensive.py
```

### VS Code Test Explorer
1. Open Test Explorer (test tube icon in sidebar)
2. Tests are automatically discovered and categorized
3. Run individual tests, test classes, or all tests
4. Debug tests with breakpoints

## Test Statistics
- **Total Tests**: 1,043
- **Unit Tests**: 213 (20%)
- **Integration Tests**: 830 (80%)
- **Test Files**: 100+ files properly organized

## Why Tests Were Skipped Before

1. **Unknown marks**: Tests with `@pytest.mark.unit` were causing warnings
2. **Wrong directory**: Unit tests in integration directory were being marked as integration tests
3. **Missing configuration**: VS Code couldn't properly discover test structure
4. **Automatic skipping**: Integration tests are skipped by default unless explicitly requested

## VS Code Test Runner Benefits

### Now Working:
- ✅ Automatic test discovery
- ✅ Proper test categorization (unit vs integration)
- ✅ No unknown mark warnings
- ✅ Fast unit test execution
- ✅ Integration test skipping when BaseX unavailable
- ✅ Test debugging with breakpoints
- ✅ Visual test results in Test Explorer

### Test Execution Strategy:
- **Development**: Run unit tests frequently (fast feedback)
- **Pre-commit**: Run integration tests (comprehensive validation)
- **CI/CD**: Run all tests with real database

## Troubleshooting

### If tests still show as skipped:
1. Check that BaseX server is running for integration tests
2. Verify Python interpreter is correctly selected in VS Code
3. Refresh test discovery: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Python: Refresh Tests"
4. Check test output panel for detailed error messages

### If unknown mark warnings persist:
1. Restart VS Code to reload pytest.ini
2. Clear pytest cache: `rm -rf .pytest_cache`
3. Verify pytest.ini is in project root

## Next Steps

1. **Use Test Explorer**: Visual interface for running tests in VS Code
2. **Run unit tests during development**: Fast feedback loop
3. **Run integration tests before commits**: Ensure everything works together
4. **Set up CI/CD**: Automated testing with real database
5. **Add more unit tests**: Increase coverage of business logic

The test configuration is now properly set up for efficient development and comprehensive testing!
