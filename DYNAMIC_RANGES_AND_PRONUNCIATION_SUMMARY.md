# DYNAMIC LIFT RANGES AND PRONUNCIATION IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of dynamic LIFT ranges and pronunciation handling in the Lexicographic Curation Workbench (LCW). The implementation ensures:

1. All variant types are extracted from `<trait>` elements in LIFT XML for the variants dropdown
2. Pronunciation language is restricted to only "seh-fonipa" with no selector
3. Notes use `<note><form lang=...><text>...</text></form></note>` structure, with language dropdowns limited to project-relevant codes
4. All language dropdowns (vernacular, translation, etc.) only offer codes found in the LIFT XML
5. Relations always use LIFT ranges for relation types

## Implementation Details

### 1. Updated Specification

The specification.md has been updated to clarify:

- Variant types MUST be extracted from `<trait>` elements, not from RANGES file
- Language dropdowns MUST only offer codes actually found in the LIFT XML
- Pronunciation language MUST be restricted to only "seh-fonipa" with no language selector
- UI components that must use dynamic ranges (grammatical info, relationship types, variant types, etymology types, notes)

### 2. API Endpoints

The `/api/ranges/variant-types-from-traits` and `/api/ranges/language-codes` endpoints have been implemented to:

- Return variant types extracted from `<trait>` elements
- Return language codes actually used in the LIFT file

### 3. Front-end Implementation

#### pronunciation-forms.js

- Manages pronunciation form items in the entry editor
- Forces "seh-fonipa" language code without exposing a language selector
- Provides consistent pronunciation management across the application

#### variant-forms.js

- Uses variant types from traits instead of morphological types
- Restricts language codes to those found in the LIFT file

#### relations.js

- Always uses LIFT ranges for relation types
- Ensures consistent relation type handling

### 4. Template Updates

The entry_form.html has been updated to:

- Include pronunciation-forms.js
- Initialize the pronunciation forms manager
- Remove any redundant IPA language selector
- Ensure pronunciation is managed via JavaScript

### 5. Testing

- Created tests to verify pronunciation language code restrictions
- Verified that variant types are correctly extracted from traits
- Validated that language codes are limited to those found in the LIFT file
- Created a script to verify pronunciation handling in the system

## Conclusion

These changes ensure that the LCW dynamically loads all linguistic data from the LIFT file, providing a true data-driven interface that adapts to the actual content. The pronunciation handling has been standardized to use only "seh-fonipa" without exposing unnecessary language selectors, simplifying the UI and ensuring consistency.

The implementation follows TDD practices with comprehensive tests for all the added functionality.
