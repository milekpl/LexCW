# Dictionary Writing System Specification

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the specifications for a Flask-based Dictionary Writing System (DWS) designed to interact with a BaseX XML database for managing large-scale lexicographic data in the LIFT format. The system aims to provide a fast, mobile-friendly interface for dictionary management with extensive customization options and advanced linguistic functionalities.

### 1.2 Background
The current workflow relies on SIL Fieldworks Explorer (Flex), which has become inadequate for managing a large lexicon containing over 153,000 entries. Performance issues necessitate moving to a dedicated hierarchical database solution with optimized operations for large datasets.

### 1.3 Project Scope
The system will:
- Provide a responsive web interface for dictionary management
- Connect to a BaseX XML database for LIFT file operations
- Support all standard lexicographic operations
- Include specialized tools for linguistic analysis and data enrichment
- Enable batch import/export functionality
- Support semantic relation management
- Allow extensive customization of input and output

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Overview
The system will be built using a three-tier architecture:
1. **Frontend**: Flask-based responsive web application
2. **Backend**: Python API for business logic and data processing
3. **Database**: BaseX XML database for storing the LIFT format dictionary

### 2.2 Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Flask, JavaScript, Bootstrap (for responsive design)
- **Backend**: Python 3.x
- **Database**: BaseX XML database
- **API**: RESTful API for communication between frontend and backend
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication

### 2.3 System Components
1. **User Interface Layer**
   - Responsive web interface
   - Mobile-friendly design
   - Customizable layouts

2. **Application Layer**
   - Dictionary management services
   - Import/Export services
   - Analysis tools
   - Search and filter services

3. **Data Access Layer**
   - BaseX XML database connector
   - LIFT format parser/generator
   - Cache management for improved performance
