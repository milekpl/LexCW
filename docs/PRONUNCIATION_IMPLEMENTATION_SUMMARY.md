# Enhanced Audio Pronunciation Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The enhanced audio pronunciation integration for the Lexicographic Curation Workbench (LCW) has been successfully implemented with the following key features:

## Key Features
- **Audio Upload**: Users can upload MP3, WAV, OGG, OPUS, and M4A files
- **Real-time Preview**: Audio files can be previewed immediately after upload
- **Progress Indication**: Upload button shows progress with spinner and status text
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **File Management**: Easy removal of uploaded audio files
- **Field Consistency**: Standardized field naming throughout the application

## Technical Implementation

### Backend API (`/api/pronunciation/upload`)
- Validates audio file format and size (max 10MB)
- Generates unique filenames to prevent conflicts
- Stores files in `/uploads/audio/` directory
- Returns JSON response with upload status and filename

### Frontend JavaScript (`pronunciation-forms.js`)
- Handles file selection and upload workflow
- Manages button states and user feedback
- Implements audio preview functionality
- Provides file removal capabilities

### Data Model
- Uses `audio_path` field to store filename
- Maintains consistency across model, template, and JavaScript
- Supports multiple pronunciations per entry

## Field Naming Convention
- **Model/Database**: `audio_path` (stores filename)
- **API Form Field**: `audio_file` (for file upload)
- **Template/JavaScript**: `audio_path` (for data binding)

## Testing
The implementation has been thoroughly tested with:
- Backend API functionality tests
- File upload/download/deletion verification
- Frontend workflow testing
- Field consistency validation
- Manual UI/UX testing

## Files Modified
1. `app/static/js/pronunciation-forms.js` - Enhanced upload workflow
2. `app/templates/entry_form.html` - Field name consistency
3. Various test files for verification (removed after testing)

## Usage
1. Navigate to an entry form
2. Locate the Pronunciation section
3. Enter IPA transcription
4. Click "Upload Audio" button
5. Select audio file from file dialog
6. Audio preview appears automatically
7. Use "Remove" button to delete if needed

The implementation is now ready for production use.
