# Lexicographic Curation Workbench (LCW) Specification v2.0

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose and Philosophy

This document outlines the specifications for the **Lexicographic Curation Workbench (LCW)**, a Flask-based system designed as an AI-augmented, bulk-processing workbench for professional lexicographers. The LCW prioritizes efficient curation of machine-generated and query-based worksets over single-entry editing, with every feature designed for scalability and validated through a rigorous Test-Driven Development (TDD) cycle.

### 1.2 Background

The current workflow relies on SIL Fieldworks Explorer (Flex), which has become inadequate for managing a large lexicon containing over 153,000 entries. Performance issues and the need for advanced AI-augmented curation workflows necessitate moving to a dedicated, scalable solution with optimized operations for large datasets and bulk processing capabilities.

### 1.3 Project Scope

The LCW will:

- Provide a TDD-validated, responsive web interface for lexicographic curation
- Implement a hybrid database architecture (BaseX + PostgreSQL) for optimal performance
- Support AI-augmented bulk processing and workbench-based curation workflows
- Include comprehensive linguistic analysis and data enrichment tools
- Enable advanced import/export functionality with format-specific optimizations
- Support complex semantic relation management and validation
- Allow extensive customization through profile-based field mapping
- Maintain full LIFT format compatibility with round-trip validation

## 7. User Interface Design

### 7.1 Layout

- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Split-pane interface for efficient editing
- Collapsible panels for advanced features

### 7.2 Entry Editor

- **Formatted Dictionary Layout**: The primary view for an entry will be a formatted, dictionary-style layout, not a raw data-entry form. This allows lexicographers to review entries in a natural, intuitive format, making it easier to spot errors and inconsistencies.
- **In-Place Editing**: Editing will be performed in-place or through minimal, context-sensitive overlays that appear on-click, preserving the dictionary-like view during curation.
- **Customizable CSS Mapping**: The layout and styling will be controlled by a customizable mapping from LIFT XML elements and attributes to CSS styles. This allows for project-specific visual conventions.
- Inline validation of entries with real-time feedback.
- Auto-save functionality to prevent data loss.
- Side-by-side comparison view for resolving duplicates or reviewing changes.

### 7.3 Search Interface

- Instant search results
- Faceted search navigation
- Visual query builder
- Search history

### 7.4 Dashboard

- Customizable widgets
- Progress tracking
- Recent activities

### 7.5 CSS Mapping for Display and Export

To ensure a consistent and customizable presentation of dictionary entries, the system will implement a powerful mapping between LIFT XML elements/attributes and CSS styles. This mechanism will be central to both the in-application entry view and various export formats.

- **Mapping Configuration**: A dedicated configuration interface will allow administrators to define rules that map specific LIFT elements (e.g., `lexical-unit`, `sense`, `definition`) and their attributes (e.g., `lang`) to CSS classes or inline styles.
- **UI Rendering**: The entry editor will use this mapping to render the dictionary-style view, transforming the underlying LIFT XML into formatted HTML for display.
- **Export Styling**: The same mapping will be applied during export to HTML, ensuring that the exported dictionary is visually consistent with the application's view. For Kindle export, a simplified version of the CSS will be used to comply with Kindle's formatting constraints while maintaining a clean, readable layout.
