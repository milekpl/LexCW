# ScopeMismatch Error Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
Fixed ScopeMismatch errors in pytest fixtures that were preventing search integration and performance tests from running.

## Root Cause
The `basex_available` fixture in `tests/conftest.py` was defined with `scope="function"`, but several test fixtures that depend on it were defined with `scope="class"`. Pytest doesn't allow broader-scoped fixtures (class) to depend on narrower-scoped fixtures (function).

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Fixture Scope in conftest.py
```python
# Before:
@pytest.fixture(scope="function")  # This was the problem
def basex_available() -> bool:

# After:  
@pytest.fixture(scope="class")  # Changed to match dependent fixtures
def basex_available() -> bool:
```

### 2. Updated Test Database Creation Logic
Fixed both `test_search_integration_comprehensive.py` and `test_performance_benchmarks.py` to properly create test databases:

- Create temporary connector without database specified
- Use `ensure_test_database()` to create the test database
- Then create the actual connector with the test database
- Improved cleanup logic using `connector.is_connected()`

### 3. Fixed Connection Cleanup
```python
# Before:
if connector.session:  # This attribute doesn't exist

# After:
if connector and connector.is_connected():  # Proper connection check
```

## Tests Now Passing
- ✅ All 8 methods in `TestSearchIntegrationComprehensive`
- ✅ All 7 methods in `TestPerformanceBenchmarks` 
- ✅ All helper test classes in `test_search_integration_comprehensive.py`
- ✅ Total: 27 tests now passing that were previously failing with ScopeMismatch

## Files Modified
1. `tests/conftest.py` - Changed `basex_available` fixture scope
2. `tests/test_search_integration_comprehensive.py` - Fixed database creation and cleanup
3. `tests/test_performance_benchmarks.py` - Fixed database creation and cleanup

This fix eliminates all ScopeMismatch errors and enables proper testing of search integration and performance benchmarks.
